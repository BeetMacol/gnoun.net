    <h1>My Musical Compositions</h1>
    Here's all the music I made in 2019 and 2020.
    <br><br>A few comments regarding the music:
    <ul>
    <li>Music from 2021 isn't here because so far all of it belongs to a soundtrack which will probably not be free. In case I decide to make
    it free, I'll send the latest music here.
    <li>It might take a bit of time to load the music. If you know a way to speed it up, please contact me.
    <li>I own the copyright to all of the musical compositions below. If you want to use it somewhere, make sure to mention the author of the music. In case this is not possible,
      contact me for further details.
    <li>Also, please don't judge the names. Sometimes I don't have good ideas with them.
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Boiling Flames (28th December, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Boiling Flames.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>The first music I made for a boss battle, but the game project it was made for was abandoned as I mentioned below multiple times. I didn't have time to make music in fall 2020
    because of huge amounts of schoolwork; this piece was started in October 2020. After I found out about equalization and started learning music theory (hmm, about time), I've made
    this track one of my best compositions compared to the previous ones. Unfortunately I wasn't experienced enough with equalization and I kept the percussion quiet throughout the
    piece in order not to distract the listener from the main melody; apart from that, the music is really cool. You won't believe it, but I came up with the beginning while learning
    to play Maple Leaf Rag on piano. My favorite moments in the music are 0:53-1:13 and the last 15 seconds.
    <br><br>
    <h3>The Spirit of Adventure (5th August, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/The Spirit of Adventure.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>One of my best pieces made in 2020. In the abandoned game project (see below), it was supposed to play in the trailer and credits. In this piece, everything cooperates
    perfectly. I've made most of the piece back in 14th June and it was destined to be the world map theme for the abandoned labyrinth game project (see Escape of the Bits). I've
    then remade the piece by replacing most of the oscillator sounds with rhodes piano and added an ending.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Temple Strider (3rd August, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Temple Strider.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>This one is really good. It features a string instrument combined with rhodes piano and some percussion. The whole piece seems well done to me without any big mistakes.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Path of the Chaotic (29th July, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Path of the Chaotic.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>The next piece I made for the abandoned game project (see below) and my first piece featuring a choir and organ. For some reason the drums only sound good when listening with headphones.
    I'm particularly proud of the organ solo part.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Steady Transiting (8th July, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Steady Transiting.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>In early July me and my friends from our game development team decided to work on a future project and I started composing music for it. Eventually the project was canceled and I
    composed 5 tracks in the meantime; this is the first one. It's a really nice composition featuring many string instruments as well as a bass sound for the first time, but I'm not
    really proud of the ending.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Forbidden Travel (28th June, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Forbidden Travel.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>After over 2 weeks of lack of inspiration caused mainly with the failed labyrinth game project (see below for more), I've managed to create this music and it's once again one of
    reflective character, once again features piano and strings, and once again gets a little more positive over time. This one also features percussion, but it isn't really fitting the
    entire piece. The name refers to the lack of time to do everything we want to do and decisions we have to make about abandoning some projects for succeeding in different ones.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Mad Pixels (15th June, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Mad Pixels.ogg" controls></audio>
    <p>Another music for the labyrinth game. I've came up with the beginning many years earlier! I was so happy to make it real.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Escape of the Bits (12th June, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Escape of the Bits.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>On June 10th I started working on a private game project about labyrinths, unfortunately abandoned in 2 weeks. I really had fun making music for it as it was finally destined for
    something, not just some music which will probably never be used. It features oscillators and percussion. It's a little similar to chiptune music.
    <br><br>
    <h3>May it Shine (29th May, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/May it Shine.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>I used to have problems whenever I didn't have inspiration for more than even just a week, and this piece is kind of a reflection on this. Once again it's a piano-strings composition,
    but this time I've came up with most of the melody on piano. The only problem I have with this piece is that the piano doesn't really fit the strings. Nevertheless, the ending is quite
    impressive.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Monotonous Moments (28th May, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Monotonous Moments.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>I'm not really proud of this one. It's a yet another piano solo.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Frozen Ravage (22nd May, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Frozen Ravage.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>This one is different from most of my music. It's a bit reflective and it lasts almost 5 minutes. You may find it very repetitive but it eventually evolves into something more.
    The main sound is... electric piano; somehow I managed to apply such effects that it sounds a bit... cold, and thus the "Frozen" in the name. Anytime the music gets more interesting,
    it is joined by a string instrument which serves as a great background. The rest is just reverbed and inversed percussion. Strange, huh?
    <br><br>
    <h3>Clown's Teeth (27th April, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Clown's Teeth.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>Again, no idea for a better name, so I picked the first one that came to my head. It's another piano solo, but a little bit more crazy with bass sounds jumping from place to
    place and a speedy melody. A friend of mine said it misses some percussion; perpahs he's right.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Windy Dream (23rd April, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Windy Dream.ogg" controls></audio>
    <p>This one has quite a rich melody and at first I underestimated this piece a bit. It's a piano combined with strings, sometimes accompanied by some percussion. These days I
    think it's fairly enjoyable.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Breathing Silence (25th March, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Breathing Silence.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>I started this track in mid January 2020. It's a bit weird; the main sound is called a "clav" in FL Studio. I've used the sound a few times in previous compositions, but this time
    it plays on low octaves and it's reverbed (but I think the decay is a little too long). The percussion isn't as good, unfortunately, as I didn't have much experience with it back then,
    especially when it comes to eccentric music. The piece consists of three melodies, the first one starts at 0:45. It used to be one of my personal favorites among my pieces and it still
    is one I really enjoy. The original piece from January included different percussion which also were playing on low octaves, but they sounded too bad and I changed them.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Against the Windpower (22nd March, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Against the Windpower.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>The last of the finished short pieces; another piano solo. The beginning might be a little too long, but I think it ends quite well.
    <br><br>
    <h3>The Fruit of Gluten (12th March, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/The Fruit of Gluten.ogg" controls></audio>
    <p>This music is a joke, the name doesn't make sense; originally it was made for a friend. I know, it's terrible.
    <br><br>
    <h3>The Inevitable (11th March, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/The Inevitable.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>A bit more sad piece, this time it's a strings solo piece. I think it should be longer. I had amazing ideas while making the chords and the convolution effect is applied here as well.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Travel's Epitome (10th March, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Travel's Epitome.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>From March 10th to March 23rd I've been working on short tracks to improve my productivity and I finished some of them. This is the first one and it's a fully improvised guitar
    solo piece. The first half of the piece seems great to me but I didn't have as much inspiration while creating the other half.
    <br><br>
    <h3>The Battle of Azgravan (9th February, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/The Battle of Azgravan.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>This music was supposed to play in the main menu of an unfinished game project called The Battle of Azgravan. Unfortunately, the audio is clipping a bit throughout most of the
    music. Luckily, the second half is a bit more listenable. As you can see, I was a little crazy at 2:27, but it eventually transforms into a quite cool melody at 2:40 and ends
    quite nicely. I might improve this piece sometime because the melody is great; perpaphs I'll make an orchestrated version.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Last Go For Broke (23rd January, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Last Go For Broke.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>Simultaneously, I was working on improving an old incomplete project from mid 2019. To the previously solo piano composition, I've added a guitar and a strange string-like sound.
    The name is supposed to mean a vision of a final showdown with an unclear result.
    <br><br>
    <h3>The Next Generation remake (22nd January, 2020)</h3>
    <audio src="music/The Next Generation remake.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>By the end of December 2019 I've checked out an FL Studio tutorial and found out about effect plugins. After a few unfinished projects in December and January, I've decided to
    improve and extend The Next Generation and the effect was quite great. It might sound a bit repetitive, though.
    <br><br>
    <h3>The Next Generation (10th November, 2019)</h3>
    <audio src="music/The Next Generation.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>I've been composing less frequently in fall 2019 because I had many other issues. In November, BeetMacol and I were preparing a modpack for the game Minecraft to play together with
    our friends, and this music played in the game's Main Menu in the modpack.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Abandon (7th July, 2019)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Abandon.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>My first completed piece that features string instruments. It gives a way more serious feeling than the previous ones. On the 2019 podium I'd give it the second place.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Motivation (29th June, 2019)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Motivation.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>I created most of this piece in 9th May, so I consider this one along with Inspiration to be the two of my initial music experiences. This is also the last piece I've made
    together with <a href="beetmacol.com">BeetMacol</a>. The main sound is once again piano, and the percussion was once again made by BeetMacol.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Grass Walker (28th June, 2019)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Grass Walker.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>I consider this piece the best one I made in 2019. I even looked back to it a lot in 2020. The inspiration and improvisation skill I had while making this piece were on their
    highest at the time and I couldn't repeat this success for a long time.
    <br><br>
    <h3>New Beginning (26th June, 2019)</h3>
    <audio src="music/New Beginning.ogg" controls></audio>
    <p>One of the two pieces I've created with my brother <a href="beetmacol.com">BeetMacol</a>. He made the percussion loop and I added the piano. The music keeps building up the whole
    time and then it ends, I think a little too fast. I may improve it sometime, but the original project file was lost, so I'd have to re-create the entire piece.
    <br><br>
    <h3>The Adventure's Start (25th June, 2019)</h3>
    <audio src="music/The Adventure's Start.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>A very positive march-like music I originally came up with back in November 2018 while playing the piano. At first I wanted the whole piece to be played by guitars or something
    alike, but I couldn't find any and I didn't know what a VSTi is at the time. In fact, the biggest problem with this music is my lack of experience with working with sounds themselves,
    so I consider this one quite a success.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Mysterious Tunnel (20th June, 2019)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Mysterious Tunnel.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>In late June 2019 I had a lot of motivation and started creating many pieces, sometimes a few at the same time. This one is a piano solo composition. The name comes from the fact
    that most of the notes used in the music formed something which looked like a tunnel to me. This music is messy at times (for example, 1:07-1:10 is quite confusing) and some sounds
    have doubled volume because I accidentally placed them twice and it wasn't visible that there are two notes in the same place. Nevertheless, this music also features some nice
    melodies; my favorite part is 0:33-0:39.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Inspiration (11th May, 2019)</h3>
    <audio src="music/Inspiration.mp3" controls></audio>
    <p>This is the first completed piece I have ever created in FL Studio. I named it "Inspiration" because I had a huge spark of inspiration at the time and I made the whole music in just
    1,5 hours. I know it doesn't sound that well, it's quite monotonous and the percussion I chose was just the basic one provided in the most basic FL Studio template, but at the time
    it was something great for me as I've never had such an experience before. After all, everything needs to start somewhere. This is where I have started.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>I started making music in either late January or in February 2019.</h3>
    At first it wasn't a serious activity and I worked on a project once in a week, two weeks, or maybe even a month at first. By late April I started to make it more often and soon I
    started creating my first pieces. The projects I worked on earlier weren't serious at all and were mostly expereriments as I was checking out how the program (FL Studio) works.
