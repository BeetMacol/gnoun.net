    <p>Here, I send some of my recent Desmos projects which I find notable.</p>

    <h2>Table Tennis (25th January, 2021)</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Have you ever thought of playing Table Tennis using mathematically designed rackets on a mathematically designed table? Now you can! (but it's difficult) I've tried to play it and you can see my efforts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S40qBdJCi8">here</a>.

    <h2>Fireworks made with math equations (31st December, 2020)</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As the year was ending, I've decided to create multiple fireworks from math equations. It was really difficult, but after several hours I've achieved my goal. The fireworks are made of linear, trigonometric and circle equations. I've added some audio to make it more realistic and spectacular and made a YouTube video out of it. You can access the project <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bp2z8gpyez">here</a>.

    <h2>Trigonometric Meadow (21st December, 2020)</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp So far this is one of my largest projects. Here, multiple flowers made of trigonometric equations appear on the plane. I've embedded the YouTube video instead of the Desmos project itself because the presentation is really long and this way you can move or stop at any moment in the video. You can access the project itself <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/v2fqg8i0kf">here</a>.

    <h2>Equations flowing around a circle (21st November, 2020)</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This is the first thing I did after discovering that it's possible to create lists of elements in Desmos which allows to graph multiple equations. Watching this while looking at the center of the circle seems to be an interesting experience to me.

    <h2>Logistic Stairs (5th November, 2020)</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I've managed to turn a sum of logistic functions into stairs. If the upper bound of the sum was infinity and the steepness of the logistic curves was also infinite, the sum would become the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions" target="_blank">floor function</a>!

    <h2>Inequality pulling a function (2nd October, 2020)</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I really like this one. I'm not sure what does the inequality represent, you may view this as a tongue or something...

    <h2>A line wandering around a circle (29th September, 2020)</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp After a bit of thinking I've managed to achieve this. It's quite nice to look at.

    <h2>Function in the Gym (20th September, 2020)</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A function lifting weigths. A friend of mine noticed that the function also resembles a tooth.

    <h2>Growing Moustache (14th September, 2020) </h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Here's the first project I've made after discovering that you can create conditions telling for what intervals can something be displayed in Desmos. With parameters in the intervals. I've also used the Taylor expansion of -sin(|x|). (By the way, this inequality below is supposed to be some kind of outfit for that head; this is certainly not vomit.)

    <h2>Inequality Dance (February/March 2020)</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This is the first project I've done after discovering the power of parameters in Desmos. It's actually a total chaos but it's fun to look at it.

    <h2>Parabola Hyperbola Flower (25th January, 2020)</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This is the first project I've saved in Desmos after discovering it's possible to save projects. In the center, there is a four-leaf flower made out of inequalities. The rest of the equations serve as decoration.
