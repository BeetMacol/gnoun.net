    <h2>Website description</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In this website, you can find various creations made by Gnoun. These include various animated graphs created in Desmos, useful math tools and music. Most of these are also accesible in Gnoun's YouTube channel and Discord server, linked above. It is recommended to use Discord if you want to contact Gnoun.
    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the "<a href="sup.html">What's up</a>" section, you can find some latest news concerning the website and beyond. ("Beyond" includes my Discord, YouTube (linked above) and news concerning myself if something's going on.) Whenever something's changing in the website or I'm adding some new math tools, I'll note that in this section.
    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the "<a href="graphs.html">Graphs</a>" section, there is a gallery of my most notable projects made in <a href="desmos.com/calculator">Desmos Graphing Calculator</a>. Each of them is described and embedded in the section.
    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the "<a href="mathtools.html">Math Tools</a>" section, I've made a set of useful tools concerning different topics in mathematics. For example, you can use the tools to find the greatest common factor of two numbers or convert a vector from cartesian form to polar form. Each tool includes an explanation, an external link to more information, and some also have a visualization made also in Desmos. In the bottom, I've put links to a few other math tools worth checking.
    <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the "<a href="music.html">Music</a>" section, I've uploaded most of my musical compositions I made in FL Studio.

    <h2>About Gnoun</h2>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm a young "mathemusician" and I do some math every day. My favorite math topics include calculus, number theory, complex numbers and differential equations. The way <a href="desmos.com/calculator">Desmos</a> works made me interested in yet another part of math, which is graphing. I've also started creating music in 2019 and I've made a few dozen pieces which are mostly of moderate quality. I make music in <a href="https://www.image-line.com/">FL Studio</a>. I'm also really interested in the English language, which is not my native language, and in languages in general. Sometimes I also do some programming, but I don't consider myself a good programmer.
